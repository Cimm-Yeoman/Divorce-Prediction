# Divorce-Prediction
Gottman Couples Therapy is a research based form of couples therapy created by Drs. John and Julie Gottman. 
The method was developed to identify issues in relationships and improve them. This report evaluates 
a data set containing 54 Divorce Predictor Scale variables, questions derived from Gottman Couples therapy, to 
assess the relationship of 170 couples across Turkey. Couples included in the study were either divorced or still 
married, and each pair responded to the predictor variable statements using a 5 level scale (0 = Never, 1 = Seldom, 
2 = Averagely, 3 = Frequently, 4 = Always). Sample questions include 
*"I can use negative statements about my spouseâ€™s personality during our discussions (33)"* 
or *"Our dreams with my spouse are similar and harmonious (15)"*. 

The goal of this report was to identify which variable best predicts divorce using decision trees and other ensemble methods. In the data set, **Class** is the response variable, with 0 = still married and 1 = divorced. 
Each predictor variable is labeled as 'Atr' with the question number attached at the end (ex. **Atr22**).
